## 2. Description
### 2.1 Problem
In a fast-paced TV/Film production environment **Video Editors** often receive Editor's notes in a **text format**. The notes would normally specify which parts of a video clip to leave and which to delete in a free form like:
```
00:01:02 good shot from here... to here 00:03:35
4:05 include this until 5:56
``` 
In the case of Documentary films or long interviews, the length of the footage and hence the notes can be very long.

### 2.2 Solution
Instead of manually selecting these clips in Video Editing Software or copy-pasting the timecode one timecode at a time this script automatically edits a single compound clip inside FinalCut Pro based on Editor's notes, therefore, increasing productivity, precision, and eliminating mistakes.

### 2.3 Motivation behind the project
I first created this workflow when I was working as a Directing and Video Editing TV mini-series. Since deadlines were tight I was looking at every opportunity to speed up the delivery times while maintaining high quality. It fit my workflow very well and has proven to be very useful.

### 2.4 Development history
It was originally built simply by using a stack of **regular expressions** executed in the TextSoap.app along with some operations in Excel and manual copy-pasting the code. Later most of the steps were combined in a single Python script which is presented here.

## 3. Technologies Used

- Python 3.9.4
- **`pandas`** 1.2.5 data analysis and manipulation tool
- **`re`** regular expression operations module

## 4. Installation

1. Download **`text_to_video_edits.py`** file from this GitHub repository.
2. Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#macos). It will contain **`pandas`** data analysis and manipulation tool.
3. Download and install the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/macOS). It will include **Python Launcher.app** to easily execute python files.

## 5. Usage
### 5.1 Prepare and export .fcpxml file
#### 5.1.1 Create new project
In FinalCut Pro **create a new project** and load clips into the timeline. Here I am duplicating the same clips to make the project over one hour long.
![clips-tml](png/clips-tml.png)
#### 5.1.2 Create and cut compound clip
Now `Select all`, choose `File -> New -> Compound Clip`, and make at least one cut of the newly created compound clip. ![cutclip](png/cutclip.png)
#### 5.1.3 Export XML
Choose `File -> Export XML`. Rename it to **`clip.fcpxml`** and save it in the same folder with `text_to_video_edits.py` file. ![fcpxml.png](png/fcpxml.png)
### 5.2 Prepare .txt file
#### 5.2.1 Write text instructions
 **Write instructions** on how you want to cut the clip. The text:
* Must contain at least **two timecodes in the same line** either in `hh:mm:ss` or `mm:ss` format.
* **May contain text** which will be discarded. 
* Lines with **less than two timecodes** will be discarded.
* Lines with **more that two timecodes** will only work with the first two. Here is a sample used in this project:

```
00:25 Starts speaking hereâ€¦ Ends speaking here 01:02
02:38 Leave this part - repeats 3 times. Ends here 03:7
the beginning is at 04:17 up to 4:31 including the action
this line without timecode will be discarded
this line with a single time code 05:48 will also be discarded
from 1:4:40 to 01:4:48
```
As you can see the formatting can be quite loose.

#### 5.2.2 Rename and move .txt file
 Paste the text into a text editor, then save it as `videoedits.txt`, and move the file into the same folder `with clip.fcpxml` and `text_to_video_edit.py`.
### 5.3 Launch Python script
Before proceeding with the next step make sure you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#macos) and [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/macOS) installed, as instructed in the [Installation](#installation) section above. 
 Right-click on `text_to_video_edit.py` file and choose `Open with -> Python Launcher.app`. This will run the script and create `export.fcpxml` file in the same folder. ![pyapp](png/pyapp.png)

### 5.4 Open export.fcpxml with FinalCut Pro
Select newly created `export.fcpxml` file and `Open with -> FinalCut Pro`. Upon opening choose the original library, then `Keep Both`. This will create the second project with the `your_original_name_1` that will include all the edits specified in `videoedits.txt` ![fcpimp](png/fcpimp.png)

**That's it!** We have just automatically edited a compound clip inside FinalCut Pro according to human written text instructions.

## 6. Project Status

The project is: ***complete***
I am no longer working on it since I am not working for TV any longer. But if you have some ideas or you want me to modify something [contact me](#contact) and we should be able to collaborate.

## 7. Known Limitations
* `videoedits.txt` file must contain at least **two timecodes** in the same line.
* The script only works with a **single compound clip**.
* The compound clip must have at least **one cut**.
* All three files must be located in the same folder.
* Input files must be named `clip.fcpxml` and `videoedits.txt`.
## 8. Room for Improvement

* **Testing** and logging the issues.
* Support cutting a **single clip** (as opposed to a compound clip).
* Support cutting **mutltiple** distinct compound and regular clips.
* Making an **executable file** without the need to install Anaconda and Python.
* **Developing GUI** to be able to specify .txt and .fcpx input files with any name and location.
* Building a **web app**.
* Designing a **report** listing the lines (with less than two timecodes) that have been **discarded**.
* Designing **error message** when end timecode is smaller than start timecode.
